<h1>Experience and Projects</h1>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Summer Intern</h3>
<p><strong>Cancer Institute of New Jersey</strong> â€” May 2024 to October 2024</p>
<p>
During this internship, I worked on impactful projects involving data automation and system verification. My responsibilities included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing Java programs to automate the extraction and transformation of medical reports into JSON format for deep learning pipelines, later converting them into CSV for enhanced usability.</li>
  <li>Building Python modules for S3-compatible buckets to verify image integrity, log processing milestones, and generate alerts, ensuring smooth daily medical data transfers.</li>
  <li>Applying MD5 checksum validation and logging for data integrity verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Key outcomes included streamlining bucket processing, reducing manual checks, and improving data handling efficiency.
