<h1>Experience and Projects</h1>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Summer Intern</h3>
<p><strong>Cancer Institute of New Jersey</strong> â€” May 2024 to October 2024</p>
<p>
During this internship, I worked on impactful projects involving data automation and system verification. My responsibilities included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing Java programs to automate the extraction and transformation of medical reports into JSON format for deep learning pipelines, later converting them into CSV for enhanced usability.</li>
  <li>Building Python modules for S3-compatible buckets to verify image integrity, log processing milestones, and generate alerts, ensuring smooth daily medical data transfers.</li>
  <li>Applying MD5 checksum validation and logging for data integrity verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Key outcomes included streamlining bucket processing, reducing manual checks, and improving data handling efficiency.

<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Advanced my knowledge of Java, Python, data transformation, and workflow automation for large-scale data management.</li>
  <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Enhanced problem-solving and communication abilities, collaborating effectively with mentors and team members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Impact:</strong> Strengthened technical capabilities, particularly in automating data workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Impact:</strong> Improved data processing efficiency and reduced manual efforts through the systems I developed.</li>
</ul>
